		<p>My name is Siplord. I adopted the technical skills I have now when I was around the age of fifteen, studying at TAFE when I was sixteen. I spent a lot of time attempting to set up various “projects” and stumbled toward my ambiguous technical goals to no avail. It was very difficult for me at this age and my resources were limited no thanks to the community that I had situated myself in. Things were dire for me, I managed to set up a forum website and had a Java based video game locally functioning on the family computer but never got around to actually putting it online as the computer had to be turned off at night. Alas, the software was an illegal software and even if I did publish it on my forum, I thought that I would be sued by a company. I configured various sources and began my quest in regards to understanding things at a more technical level, at the age of nineteen I got a lot more serious about networking; setting up forums on my Ubuntu and Windows (my first servers were on AWS) servers that I managed by myself. I have been hacked a few times, this is what happens when you use software that is not yours and the source pertains an unverified owner that remains anonymous due to the source being an illegal software. Nonetheless I had a lot of fun.</p>
